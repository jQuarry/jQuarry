# jQuarry
A product of :heart: by the jQuarry team for #BrickHack2015.

Play the Game
=============
Download a release [here](https://github.com/jQuarry/jQuarry/releases). Unzip all the files into a location of your choosing.

Then, to access the game, point a (GUI-based) web browser of your choosing to `file:///your/path/here/jQuarry/index.html`.

How to Play
===========
The point of the game is to excavate mines that have web technologies inside of them. Every web technology is worth a positive amount of points. Anything that is not a web technology will cause you to lose the game. If you unearth every web technology in a given board, you will go up a level; higher levels mean higher amounts of points available but also higher stakes. Try to get the highest score possible.

_(editor's note: the highest I've seen in recent history is 62.)_

The numbers on the right side of the board represent the total amount of points worth of web technologies living in mines in this row (the top number), and the number of non-web-technologies that live in mines in this row (the bottom number, next to the red icon). The same format follows for the columns: the number on top of the bottom row of each column is the points in that column; the number next to each red icon is the number of baddies in the column.

Contributing
============
Basically submit any pull requests you want. We wrote this at a hackathon, the code is absolutely disgusting.
